@user1 @web
Scenario: Como autor creo un post y lo elimino
    Given I navigate to page "<HOST>" "ghost/#/signin"

    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "posting"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I post the post
    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "post created"
    And I wait for a signal containing "checking post" for 30 seconds
    And I wait for a signal containing "checked post" for 30 seconds
    And I return to posts list
    And I select the listed post with name "$$name_1"
